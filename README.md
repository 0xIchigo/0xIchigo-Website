# 0xIchigo's Site

Welcome to 0xIchigo's personal portfolio and blog. This site is dedicated for my personal portfolio and blog (nonsensical ramblings on various technical and philosophical topics, including those related to and neighboring blockchains, cybersecurity, smart contracts, economics, law, and politics)

This site is largely built with Next.js and TypeScript, using Tailwind CSS for styling and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for managing dependencies. The background for the site was created in Three.js, and all blogposts are written in markdown, but are converted to HTML using [gray-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter) and [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark)
